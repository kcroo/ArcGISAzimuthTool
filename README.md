# ArcGISAzimuthTool
This is a tool for ArcGIS for Desktop to be used by my current workplace's soils crew. This tool automates the frequent process of calculating the azimuths of soil monitoring transects and editing the new azimuth transect shapefile. The user should create a polyline shapefile in the appropriate spatial reference and add an Id field that can contain integers. Then they should run the SoilTransects script in the Soils - Linear Directional Mean toolbox. That script will update the Id values; run the linear directional mean tool; output to the same file name as the input shapefile plus _az (e.g. MyUnit123.shp outputs to MyUnit123_az.shp); delete unneeded fields in the attribute table; convert line distances from meters to feet; and round azimuths to the nearest integer.
